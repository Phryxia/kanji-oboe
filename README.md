# Kanji Oboe

Kanji Oboe is the specialized web application for learning Japanese Kanji and their pronounciation, in two types of reading: onyomi and kunyomi. Oboe(覚え) means 'memorize' in Japanese imperative form. It's inspired by [Kanji Quizzer](http://www.studykanji.net/).

Kanji Oboe has carefully selected copyright-free data to make the entire service available under the GPL. Free knowledge should be shared through free service. Kanji Oboe will never make any profit including google ads.

Kanji Oboe is still work in progress. I have plans for supporting both English and Korean.
